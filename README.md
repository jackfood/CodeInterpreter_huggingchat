## Purpose of This Program

The primary objective of this program is to automate the execution of code (simulate as **Code Interpreter**) in response to input received from the Hugging Chat API (**huggingchat**). It is designed to intelligently parse chatbot responses, detect Python code blocks or `pip install` commands, and execute them seamlessly. This automation process makes it convenient for users without extensive coding experience to interact with the chatbot and execute code effortlessly. There is no GUI for this idea yet.

### Key Features and Functionality

#### 1. Auto Code Execution
   - When the program interacts with the Hugging Chat API, it can detect Python code snippets within the chatbot's responses.
   - The program extracts and runs these Python code snippets automatically, providing real-time feedback on the code's execution.

#### 2. Error Handling
   - In cases where Python code execution results in an error, the program captures the error message.
   - The error message is then copied and processed for user visibility, facilitating troubleshooting and debugging.

#### 3. Package Installation
   - The program also has the capability to recognize `pip install` commands in chatbot responses.
   - When it detects such commands, it proceeds to install the specified Python packages without user intervention.

#### 4. User-Friendly
   - The program is designed with non-coders in mind, ensuring that users with minimal coding experience can comfortably interact with the chatbot.
   - It abstracts the complexity of code execution and package management, making it accessible to a wider audience.

#### 5. Continuous Execution
   - The program operates continuously without a predefined "stop" option, allowing users to engage in an extended conversation with the chatbot.

#### 6. Generated by AI
   - It's important to note that this program was entirely generated by huggingface free chat using openassistant, llama 2 or codellama 2, with no human coding involvement. It demonstrates the potential for AI-driven solutions to bridge the gap between complex technical tasks and individuals with innovative ideas but limited coding experience.

In summary, the Half-CodeInterpreter_HFembedded program is a user-friendly and automated solution that empowers users to interact with the Hugging Chat API, execute Python code, handle errors, and install packages effortlessly. Its development showcases the capabilities of AI in turning ideas into functional software tools, even for those with minimal coding expertise.

## Getting Started

Before you can use this Half-CodeInterpreter, you'll need to set up your environment and configure the necessary files.

### Prerequisites

- a huggingface account (if not done yet, sign up for free)
- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Hugging Chat API](https://github.com/Soulter/hugging-chat-api) library

## Installation

To get started with the Half-CodeInterpreter, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Hugging Chat API Repository:**

   First, clone the [Hugging Chat API](https://github.com/Soulter/hugging-chat-api) repository and install the `hugchat` library by running the following commands in your terminal and set up API:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soulter/hugging-chat-api.git
   cd hugging-chat-api
   pip install hugchat
   ```

2. **Clone this Repository:**

   Add in the file located in Half-CodeInterpreter repository and navigate to its directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Half-CodeInterpreter_HFembedded.git
   cd Half-CodeInterpreter_HFembedded
   ```

3. **Copy Required Files:**

   Copy all the required files, including `CodeInterpreterHF.py`, `extractpython.py`, `installpip.py`, and the `.env` configuration file, to your project directory.

4. **Configure `.env` File:**

   Rename example.env to .env. Open up `.env` file with your Hugging Face credentials (email and password).

Now your Half-CodeInterpreter is set up and ready to use. You can proceed to the "Usage" section for instructions on how to run the chatbot interface and interact with the AI chat service.

   ```bash
   python CodeInterpreterHF.py
   ```

## Usage

To use the Half-CodeInterpreter and interact with the AI chat service, follow these steps:

1. **Run the CodeInterpreterHF.py Script:**

   Use the following command to run the `CodeInterpreterHF.py` script using Python:

   ```bash
   python CodeInterpreterHF.py
   ```

   This script launches the chatbot interface, allowing you to:

   - Start conversations with the AI chat service.
   - Send user input to the chatbot.
   - Extract and execute Python code from chatbot responses.
   - Manage Python package installations as needed.

2. **Interact with the Chatbot:**

   Once the chatbot is running, you can interact with it by following the on-screen instructions. Here are some common actions you can perform:

   - Enter user input when prompted and receive responses from the chatbot.
   - Use 'q' or 'quit' to exit the chatbot.
   - Use 'c' or 'change' to change the conversation.
   - Use 'n' or 'new' to start a new conversation.

3. **Extract and Execute Python Code:**

   When the chatbot responds with Python code, the script will extract and execute it. You can observe the execution of Python code and any output or errors in the console.

4. **Manage Package Installations:**

   If the chatbot instructs you to install Python packages, the script will handle it automatically. You don't need to manually install packages; the script will execute the necessary installation commands.


## Files and Explanation

This repository contains several files that play crucial roles in the functioning of the Half-CodeInterpreter_HFembedded project:

1. **CodeInterpreterHF.py**:
   - This is the primary script responsible for interfacing with the AI chat service and managing Python code execution.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Imports necessary libraries and modules.
     - Loads user credentials securely from the `.env` file.
     - Manages conversations with the AI chat service.
     - Accepts user input and communicates with the chatbot.
     - Extracts and executes Python code from AI responses.
     - Manages the installation of Python packages as required.

     ** edit the code llm(x) to the number correspond to the model below
        0: `meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf`

        2: `codellama/CodeLlama-34b-Instruct-hf`
        3: `tiiuae/falcon-180B-chat`

2. **extractpython.py**:
   - A supporting script for extracting Python code from AI responses and updating `aipythonanswer.txt`.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Reads AI responses from `aianswer.txt`.
     - Extracts Python code enclosed in triple backticks (```python```).
     - Compares and updates the extracted code in `aipythonanswer.txt`.

3. **installpip.py**:
   - Another supporting script responsible for installing Python packages specified in `installpip.txt`.
   - **Functionality**:
     - Reads the package name from `installpip.txt`.
     - Constructs a `pip install` command for the specified package.
     - Executes the `pip install` command to install the package.

4. **.env**:
   - The `.env` file is a configuration file used to store sensitive information, such as your Hugging Face credentials (email and password).
   - **Functionality**:
     - Stores `HFEMAIL` and `HFPASSWORD` environment variables securely.
     - These credentials are loaded by `CodeInterpreterHF.py` to log in to the AI chat service safely.

These files work together to create a functional Half-CodeInterpreter that allows you to interact with the AI chat service, extract and execute Python code, and manage Python package installations when necessary. Make sure to configure the `.env` file with your actual Hugging Face credentials before running the project.
